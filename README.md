# STM32E407
All the basic prep work for DALI_final_program. 

Essentially I want to divide the prep work for the DALI_Programing into three parts 
    
    1. Basic concepts involved in DALI programming
       These are the basic concepts that I want to implement to get myself comfirtable with the STM32E407 board.
       
       a. Blink_LED      COMPLETED (WORKING)
       b. IWDG           COMPLETED (WORKING)
       c. Flash Program  COMPLETED (WORKING)
    2. Manchester Encoding and Decoding
       
    3. Basic DALI Transanction Loop
